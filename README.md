# Ecommerce Data Analysis using SQL and Python

This project demonstrates an eCommerce data analysis workflow using SQL and Python. The analysis covers storing data in a SQL database, retrieving and manipulating it using Python, and visualizing insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For data storage and query execution.
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL Connector**: To connect Python to the SQL database.
- **Pandas**: For handling and manipulating DataFrames.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data trends.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization.

## Analysis and Visualization

The analysis includes various SQL queries for extracting insights from the eCommerce data, such as:
- Customer segmentation
- Order and sales trends
- Product performance
- Revenue analysis
- Customer behavior insights

Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib are used for further data manipulation, trend analysis, and visualization.
